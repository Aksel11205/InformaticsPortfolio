            <h1>Travel to Tunisia!</h1>

            <h2>There are several places yout should visit while you are there:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sahara desert</li>
                <li>Carthage</li>
                <li>Tunis (the capital city)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="Sahara">Sahara Desert</h3>
            <p>The Sahara desert is a perfect location for whoever seeks adventure. There you can ride an actual camel
                or an quad. You have the opportunity to sleep in an oasis and enjoy typical tunisian food. </p>
            <img src="images/sahara.jpg" width="300">
            <h3>Carthage</h3>
            <p>The ancient city of Carthage is now a tourist attraction. You can look around the remainings of the
                typical baths of the Roman people. Also you can enjoy a pretty nice view of the sea and take one or two
                pictures. </p>
            <img src="images/carthage.jpg" width="300">
            <h3>Tunis (the capital city)</h3>
            <p>The part of the city is perfect for long walks. You can enjoy the typical tunisian street which has shops
                all around it. What is more is that Tunis has its own Shanzelize and Big Ben which is very interesting.
            </p>
