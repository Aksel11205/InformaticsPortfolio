			<h2>Information about me:</h2>
			<p>I am Aleksandar Aleksandrov and i am a student at the American College of Sofia. I am currently in 12th
				grade studying Physics and I am really interested in it. Also I love playing and watching tennis,
				basketball and volleyball. What is more, I am a very good chef. My special cuisine is sushi and
				different types of risotto (with chicken, seafood, etc.).</p>
			<p>I have learnt very useful things about how HTML and CSS actually work. However, I am no master in this
				sphere that is why i still donâ€™t quite understand how some things work. I learnt how to style a webpage
				and how to program one but on a very basic level. I improved my skills because in the beginning I
				couldn't even write a single line of code and here i am not programming my own webpage. I found the
				course very useful indeed. I hope to learn something more about how HTML and CSS work (on a deeper
				level). My goals were to figure out how to program a webpage and I succeeded.
